This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## How to Install Sanity in the Next.js Project

When you first install Next.js as usual using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest <project-name>
```

Then install Sanity using:

```bash
npm i sanity@latest
```

When you enter your project's directory like:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

Then copy the link provided from the Sanity dashboard and paste it in the VSCode Terminal. After 5 minutes, boom, your Sanity project is initialized. See you tomorrow.

## Accessing Sanity Studio

To add data following the schema you created, navigate to the Sanity Studio by opening the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/studio
```

Make sure your development server is running. You can now add and manage your content using the Sanity Studio interface.
